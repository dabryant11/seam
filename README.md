The zip code piece seemed odd to me to do this without creating a field where the user would input this info but if this was the decided route I would explore using one of these API services to gather the zip code data then add the zip code with the most occurrences to the filter logic

With additional time I would have liked to...
Set up a css file to avoid inline styling
Used cypress for end to end testing to solidify any POST,PATCH and DELETE requests and also add a confirmation/error banner prior to any redirects

Happy to answer any clarifying questions

I enjoyed this assessment and look forward to joining the team!
